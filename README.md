# Privacy in the World of Data Science

This repository contains the source code for the *Privacy in the World of Data Science* - A workshop introducing the importance of data privacy and privacy preserving machine learning techniques.

## Data

We would use the built-in datasets in the scikit-learn library, so there is no need to download from any data sources externally.

## Getting Started

The project was developed using python 3.6.7 with the following packages.
- Scikit-learn
- Diffprivlib

Installation with pip:
``` 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Files
- private-classification-naive.ipynb : Jupyter Notebook outlining the usage of Differentially Private Naive Bayes for classification problems
- requirements.txt : pre-requiste libraries for the project

## Summary

## Acknowledgements
